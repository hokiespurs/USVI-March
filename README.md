# USVI-March
The "issues" will be a working todo list for the upcoming field work.  You can "assign" issues, have discussions for updates on issues, and set milestones.

Our 2 milestones are:
1. shipping date (March 5th)
2. travel date (Mar 19th)

I also might put some code in here for initial analysis of data

Not sure if this is even a good idea for our todo list, so we'll see if we actually use it.
